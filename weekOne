# First impressions from week 1

I am glad we covered GitHub as a form of technical communication this week. 
I had some experience with GitHub while attending a coding boot camp at the University of MN. 
We would have to use GitHub to document our progress on the websites we were developing.
The best part about documenting your hard work as a web developer or software engineer is creating a file where you 
can explain your process and form of thinking to the reader. 

***## Topic 1: Docs as Code For Self-Reflection***
GitHub is an excellent platform for practicing technical communication, as I described, which fosters a relationship with your audience and clarifies your thought process through your work. 
More importantly, utilizing GitHub as a form of documenting your hard work is a great way to reflect on your coding experience. 
Countless times, I created hundreds of lines of code and had nowhere to hold them except in VS Studio. 
GitHub allows me, as the creator, to look at the code and the description of my thought process from the previous day. 
When I logged into GitHub the next day, I reflected on my thought process as I was writing the code. 

 ***## Topic 2: Markdown and User Experience***
The user experience with GitHub is profound in its ability to foster a positive relationship with its users. 
The simplicity of logging into a free form of documentation is unique. 
If more people understood how to document something in general, they would prefer to use a similar format to GitHub. 
GitHub is also very reliable and provides its users with a quality and comforting data cloud that can be used anywhere. 
The GitHub app on any mobile device enables users to check in on their work. 
The mobile application allows users to stay on track with their goals and quickly document their thoughts and creativity, ultimately benefiting their company or career position. 

***## Topic 3: Github is for Collaboration***
As I write this document, I am aware that GitHub offers incredible markup for collaboration. 
While the markup is not as easy as selecting a button on the tab bar, it is a valuable tactic when considering the coding portion of the website or mobile application. 
Having something like an asterix or a hashtag reads just like any other form of language. 
Once you feel you are conditioned to remember the specific coding language, it will become second nature. 
I also appreciate being able to comment on the work that I have written. 
Others can use a link, highlight what they find interesting or concerning, and then comment. 
The user can therefore check on those comments through their mobile application and update their work depending on the feedback. 

I have watched GitHub evolve over the years, and it is much easier to use now than it was twelve years ago. 
The tabs are significantly more relatable and provide a better user experience. 
The coding boot camp never really discussed the best practices of GitHub, but some interesting classes could enhance the workplace and speed up projects worldwide.
Utilizing such technologies is helping companies evolve and grow, just like GitHub.
