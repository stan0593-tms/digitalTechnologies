# First impressions from week 1

I am glad we covered GitHub as a form of technical communication this week. 
I had some experience with GitHub while attending a coding boot camp at the University of MN. 
We would have to use GitHub to document our progress on the websites we were developing.
The best part about documenting your hard work as a web developer or software engineer is creating a file where you 
can explain your process and form of thinking to the reader. 

***## Topic 1: Docs as Code For Self-Reflection***
GitHub is an excellent platform for practicing technical communication, as I described, which fosters a relationship with your audience and clarifies your thought process through your work. 
More importantly, utilizing GitHub as a form of documenting your hard work is a great way to reflect on your coding experience. 
Countless times, I created hundreds of lines of code and had nowhere to hold them except in VS Studio. 
GitHub allows me, as the creator, to look at the code and the description of my thought process from the previous day. 
When I logged into GitHub the next day, I reflected on my thought process as I was writing the code.
